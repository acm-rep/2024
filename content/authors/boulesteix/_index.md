**Title:** TBD.

**Abstract:** TBD.

**Bio:** I am associate professor for Computational Molecular Medicine at the Department of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology.  

Since 2009, I have been initiating and conducting projects on research reproducibility, validation, reporting, fishing for significance and false research findings, publication bias, benchmarking, and neutral comparisons of statistical methods; some of these activities are funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). I am a Chair of the "simulation panel" of the STRATOS initiative and the Associate Editor for Europe of Briefings in Bioinformatics, a journal specialized in reviews and comparison studies.
