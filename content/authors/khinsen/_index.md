**Reproducibility and replicability of computer simulations**

**Abstract:** Since the early days of the reproducibility crisis, much progress has been made in understanding and improving computational reproducibility and replicability (R&R). What have we accomplished so far, and what remains to be done? I will concentrate on the state of R&R in computer simulations, i.e. experiments on computational models, leaving aside the additional complications of dealing with observational data.

The questions I will address include: Should computer simulations be
made reproducible? Why? At what cost? To the last bit, or on a "good
enough" basis? Can we ensure reproducibility without repeating lengthy computations? Is replicability more or less important than
reproducibility in scientific practice? How replicable are computer
simulations today? What are the obstacles to better replicability?

**Bio:** Konrad Hinsen is a CNRS researcher at the Centre de Biophysique Moléculaire in Orléans and at the Synchrotron SOLEIL in Saint Aubin (France). His main field of research is computational biophysics, and in particular the structure and dynamics of proteins. A long-standing interest in improving the practices in computational science has lead him to research on scientific computing and to the development of software tools. In 1995, he was a co-founder of the Numerical Python project, which started the Scientific Python ecoystem inside which he then developed tools for molecular simulation. Today he is a contributor to the Guix project, focusing on its use in reproducible computations. He is also a co-author of two MOOCs on reproducible computational research, and a co-founder of the journal "ReScience C" that publishes replication work in computational science.
